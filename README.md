# Kangshub
A kangaroo algorithm work is similar but highy advanced by me so check it out 

# Usage:

> python kangaroo.py -p {LOCATION OF FILE CONTAINING PUBLICKEYS} -keyspace {STARTING RANGE:ENDING RANGE} -R/r {FOR RANDOM MODE OF KEYS GENERATION} -ncore {FOR NUMBER OF CPU THREADS} -t/T (Interval time in seconds for range reset)

# FINDINGD OF [ FOUND ?? ] ??

So if you think that your code shows [ found xoxo ]
then you are looking for outputs you might going go crazzy for moneyyy yess im too but.....
> 1. the speed it shows TERAKEYS/SEC is true and accurate...    but the speed which it shows after  is also true and the findings define the curve bcz of COINCURVE AND SECRETS IMPROVEMENT the found numbers means that Found ( NO.) means that it has found (NUMBER OF ) keys which had similar patterns to rest of the keys It will hoping on each and every completey similar pubkey It means that if key is 40 digit long 39 digit matched yeahhh ik this shit is to check curve process and also bcz of the pattrens a lot of pattrens from publickeysfile its overloading the table so if youre using more than 100 million stings chances of hitiing will be 10X as compared to BSGS bcz of the RAM usag

# PROCESS IS SAME BUT THE WORK HAS CHANGES USING KANGAROO ALGORITHM..

2. with no doubt its still 1.6 times slower than BSGS but the accuracy with curve will make you rich
3. speed doesn't matter in this if the program is going accurately then you will be rich as F*** .... ( SSORRY )
4.  SO DONT WORRIE ABOUT SPEED WHICH IT SHOWS AFTER AND THE FINDING ALSO IT SOMETIMES OVERLOAD WHEN THE BIT IS SAMLLL LIKE
> THE TEST WAS ABOUT 1 TO 67 BIT AND AFTER FINDING THE COMMAND IS TO COMPLETELY SCAN NEAR BY RANGE BY TOO AND FOE METHOD AND ITS FKED AFTER FINDING
> 0X60 KEY BCZ OF END OF THE RANGE OTHER WISE IT WILL WORK FINE

@FOR WINDOWS AND LINUX VERSION NOT FOR MOBILES......

> It will load keys then generate so we don't have to look fot single key and if any of
 [any of keys match it will do bingo!!]
>
> Its load keys and doo this but sometimes even after running for hours it found nothing not even the keys which supposed to be there
